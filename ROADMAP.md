# LDQIS Lab Website — Roadmap

The plan for the lab's public website: what's shipped, what's planned, and the principles
behind it. Day-to-day status lives in [IMPL.md](./IMPL.md); git history has the full record.

The site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and deploys automatically to GitHub
Pages on every push to `main`. It's intentionally static — no backend, no database, no login.

## Principles

These hold across redesigns; changing any is a deliberate decision, not drift.

- **No backend, no auth, no database.** The previous site's login / register / data-view
  surface was its main source of risk. Design any new feature as a build-time artifact
  (Markdown + frontmatter in git) first; only escalate to server state if a static answer
  truly can't do the job.
- **Content as code.** Adding a person, project, publication, or news post is one Markdown
  commit. If editorial volume outgrows git, layer a git-based editor (Sveltia / Decap) onto
  the existing content collections — never a database.
- **Fast and light.** Astro ships zero JavaScript by default; interactivity is added only
  where it's needed (theme toggle, search). The bar is a perfect Lighthouse score across all
  four categories.
- **Accessibility is a check, not a vibe.** WCAG 2.2 AA on every page, enforced on every
  pull request by Playwright and axe-core. No manual-only a11y claims.
- **Stable identity.** The LDQIS name and RIT branding (PMS 1505c orange, F6BE00 yellow,
  Instrument Serif + Inter type) stay constant across redesigns.
- **Research before architecture.** Framework, library, and pattern choices are checked
  against current best practice and recorded in a `research(YYYY-MM):` note in the code —
  the same provenance habit as the lab's published work.
- **Don't build around gaps that are about to close.** Before hand-rolling a shim (image
  optimization, RSS, a content loader), check whether the framework already ships it or is
  about to; when a major version lands, revisit the workarounds it makes unnecessary.

## Planned

### Custom domain — `dataqualitylabs.com`

The lab owns the domain; moving the site onto it (gated on DNS access):

1. Verify the domain through
   [GitHub's domain-verification flow](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages)
   (prevents subdomain takeover).
2. Add a `CNAME` file with `dataqualitylabs.com`.
3. Point DNS (`dataqualitylabs.com` and `www`) at GitHub Pages.
4. Let the HTTPS certificate auto-provision, then enable "Enforce HTTPS".
5. Confirm the old site is fully offline (old URLs return 404, not stale data).

A single build flag (`CUSTOM_DOMAIN`) already switches between the GitHub Pages path and the
apex domain, so the flip is one change once DNS resolves.

### Backlog (unprioritized)

- **Research areas / themes** — group the lab's work by problem area (data quality,
  integrity, security) on the homepage and a research page, each theme linking its projects,
  publications, and people. research(2026-06): peer lab sites (Stanford AI, Oxford OATML)
  and lab-website guidance lead with research _by theme_ over a flat paper list, so a
  visitor grasps what the lab works on before the formal publications. Source:
  theacademicdesigner.com, OpenScholar lab-site structure.
- **Join the lab** — a static "open positions / prospective students" page (what the lab
  looks for, how to apply via the existing intake form / contact), refreshed before
  recruiting season. research(2026-06): all three peer sites surface a recruiting CTA, and
  guidance names prospective students + collaborators as the primary audience judging a lab
  site. Source: theacademicdesigner.com, SFU Library research-website tips.
- **News post images** — one optional Astro-optimized image per news entry.
  research(2026-06): every peer site pairs each news item with a thumbnail for scanability;
  one field, no architecture cost.
- **Admin (Sveltia CMS) UX** — the no-code `/admin` editor is live; streamline its editing
  experience (clearer fields, smoother flows) as more lab members start using it.
- **Collaborators / partners** — credit the partner institutions and people the lab works
  with (the funder list now ships as the **Funded By** section). research(2026-06): OATML
  ("Collaborators") and Stanford ("Affiliates") surface partnerships as a credibility
  signal, and the data already lives on the PI's page and in grant records, so it's ready to
  build rather than "someday".
- **Search** — Pagefind or Astro's built-in, once the publication list grows enough to
  warrant it.
- **Per-project demo embeds** — interactive project demos as embedded islands, if and when
  the demos have hosted surfaces.
- **Multi-author news bylines** — when a post has more than one author.
- **Internationalization** — only if a lab member needs it.

### Looked at, deliberately not doing

research(2026-06): reviewed three peer lab sites (Stanford AI, Oxford OATML, UTRGV MI) for
ideas. These were weighed and declined, recorded so they aren't re-proposed:

- **A live social-media feed** (Stanford embeds X/Twitter) — a third-party feed is JS-heavy,
  breaks the zero-JS-by-default / perfect-Lighthouse / a11y bar, and rots when the platform
  changes (cf. Storify's shutdown). If social presence matters, use a static "follow us"
  link row or curate highlights as news. Source: Nieman Lab.
- **A dedicated events / talks page** — events pages are the top staleness liability for lab
  sites. The existing `news` collection already carries talks and defenses and auto-hides
  drafts + future-dated posts at build; revisit a separate page only with a sustained,
  maintained cadence and the same auto-archive. Source: The Academic Designer.
- **A heavy per-course collection** (syllabi, schedules) — duplicates the RIT catalog and
  goes stale; the shipped **Teaching** section (a thin link-out list) covers the need instead.
- **A rotating / punny banner** (OATML's oat puns) — characterful, but it fights the "stable
  identity" principle and isn't worth the churn.

## Shipped

Highlights below; full history in git.

- **Publication code links.** A publication can reference the lab project that implements it
  (a `project` field); the paper then surfaces a "Code" cross-link to that project on its
  detail page and in the homepage list (the InteFL paper links the `fl-execution-framework`
  repo). No artifact badge — none of the lab's papers went through formal artifact
  evaluation, so the schema stays ready for a real badge rather than faking one.
- **Teaching.** A homepage section lists the courses lab members teach — Dr. Reznik's
  undergraduate CSCI-331/531/532 and graduate CSCI-630/734/735/736/788 — as a thin inline
  list that links out to his maintained course pages rather than duplicating syllabi, with
  the course code as the identity anchor.
- **Funded By.** A homepage section credits the lab's competitive research awards — NSF
  (incl. SMORES #2321652 and IMPRESS-U), DoD / Army Research Office, and CRDF Global with the
  U.S. Department of State — NSF titles and dates verified against the NSF Awards API, under a
  federal-funding disclaimer.
- **Astro 6.** Upgraded from the 5.x line; `overrides.vite: ^7` keeps npm from hoisting
  Vite 8 (which breaks the build) and cleared the 5.x advisories.
- **Slim content-PR gate.** Content PRs (Markdown under `src/content/**`) merge on a fast
  `Build` (schema validation) + `pin-check`; the full app suite (lint, type-check, unit,
  E2E + a11y, Lighthouse) skips via a job-level `if:` (rationale in `ci.yml`).
- **Intake forms + email chip.** Issue forms open auto-generated, reviewed PRs for profiles,
  projects, and publications — comma-separated tags/stack, names derived from the issue
  title, each validated by `astro build` before the PR opens. Email renders as a
  click-to-mail chip with an inline copy button.
- **Profile cards.** Team cards show a photo (uploaded, GitHub-handle, or initials), social
  and academic links (website, GitHub, LinkedIn, YouTube, ORCID, Scholar, IEEE), and years
  in the lab.
- **Academic discovery metadata.** Publication pages emit Highwire `citation_*` tags (what
  Google Scholar reads), plus schema.org JSON-LD and a sitemap.
- **News + RSS.** A `news` collection with an index, per-post pages, and a valid RSS 2.0
  feed; drafts and future-dated posts are excluded at build time.
- **Content collections + detail pages.** Projects, publications, and people are Astro
  content collections, each with a prerendered detail page; projects and publications
  cross-link to the people who authored or built them.
- **Supply-chain hardening + CI.** GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs with a Dependabot
  cooldown; the per-PR suite runs lint, type-check, unit, a11y, and Lighthouse on app PRs.
